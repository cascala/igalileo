Place all these files (including the .sh files) in a new folder galileo in your home or user directory:
* Mac:`~/Library/Jupyter/kernels/galileo/kernel.json`
* Linux: `~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels\galileo\kernel.json`
* Windows: `%APPDATA%\jupyter\kernels\galileo\kernel.json`

Edit kernel.json to point to either run_docker of run_sbt.
I've noticed sometimes relative paths (using ./run_docker.sh for instance) does not work.
Use the full file name instead

Ensure the run_docker.sh and run_sbt.sh scripts are executable
